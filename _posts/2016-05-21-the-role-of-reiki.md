  "Reiki re-establishes the free flow of energy by opening, cleaning and
  clearing blockages and stagnant energies at the physical, mental, emotional,
  and spiritual level. It also balances and harmonizes all the aspects of your
  being by increasing your vibration. Through Reiki sessions you open and become
  aware of the lessons that the dis-ease or discomfort has to teach. This
  awareness enables the dis-ease to begin to transmute." Vivian Quijano
